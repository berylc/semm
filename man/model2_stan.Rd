\title{Identify sex-specific variants using SEMM.}
\usage{
model2_stan(dat = NULL, B = NULL, SE = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{input data object, produced from prep_gwas_input()}

\item{B}{optional, if dat is not provided,
a data frame containing beta estimates from GWAS summary statistics.
each row corresponds to a variant and each column corresponds to
a group (e.g. males and females)}

\item{SE}{optional, if dat is not provided,
a data frame containing SE estimates from GWAS summary statistics,
 each row/column refers to the same variant and group as the beta values}
}
\value{
An object of class `stanfit` returned by `rstan::sampling` fitted to model2
}
\description{
This function takes as input paired betas and standard errors from GWAS summary
statistics and outputs a fitted four component model that can be used to assign
variants to components.
